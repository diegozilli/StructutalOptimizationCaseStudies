# StructutalOptimizationCaseStudies_SAMO_article

This repository contains the data and some code used in the simulations presented in our research article titled "Modal analysis and structural optimization of integrated bladed disks and centrifugal compressor impellers" published in the Journal of Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (SAMO) Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. This README provides an overview of the repository's contents and instructions on how to access and use the data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `benchmark_functions/`: This directory contains all the benchmark functions.

- `datasets/`: This directory contains the datasets used to train and test the metamodels.

- `trained_models/`: This directory contains the metamodels trained for the benchmark functions and blisk cases.

- `README.md`: You are reading it! This file provides an overview of the repository.
